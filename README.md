# DeltaTube
A YouTube revival that had two name changes.
## Why this repository is archived
The JarkTube/FalconTube code was really shitty and had flaws in it, so I'm rewriting it and discontinuing this codebase.
You can still use this code, as long as you fix and implement some stuff.
## Requirements
- A webserver with PHP (Apache or Nginx)
- Windows
- A brain

## How to use
Just copy the files in /web to the root of your webserver.

With PHPMyAdmin, import the .sql file in the /sql folder.

Open the function.php file in /important and changes the username and password to the one set in MYSQL.

The homepage should have errors because there is no videos in the DB.
